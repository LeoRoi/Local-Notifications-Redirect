# Local-Notifications-Redirect
Redirecting to particular UIViewController using the observer pattern.

Force quit the app or go in the background to trigger a Local Notification after 5 seconds. Depending on the way you are leaving, will either go in active or inactive view controller. Only SplashVC and OtherVC are responsive to the local notification.
